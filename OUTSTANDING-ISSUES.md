# Outstanding Issues - Continue From Here Next Time

## üî¥ Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Automatic Failover is Broken
**Problem**: Lambda doesn't automatically failover when instances fail
**Location**: `failover.py` and `fix-failover.tf`
**What's Wrong**:
- Lambda expects SNS message format but gets CloudWatch directly
- Target groups not updated when failover happens
- Primary instance doesn't stop when backup starts

**Fix Required**:
```python
# In Lambda function, fix event parsing:
# Change from: event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']
# To handle: CloudWatch direct invocation
```

### 2. Load Balancer Target Groups Incomplete
**Problem**: Services not properly registered with load balancers
**What's Missing**:
- ALB listener rules for /signaling, /api paths
- NLB listeners for COTURN (3478/3479)
- Health check configuration

**Fix Required**:
```hcl
# Add to Terraform:
resource "aws_lb_listener_rule" "signaling" {
  # Route /signaling to signaling target group
}
```

### 3. No DNS Failover
**Problem**: No Route53 configuration for automatic DNS updates
**What's Needed**:
- Route53 hosted zone
- Health checks for each service
- Failover routing policies

## üü° Important Improvements Needed

### 1. Switch to Auto Scaling Groups
**Current**: Manual primary/backup instances
**Better**: Use ASG with min=1, max=2
**File**: `asg-solution.tf` (already written, not deployed)
**Benefit**: AWS handles failover automatically

### 2. Application Health Checks
**Current**: Only checking if EC2 is running
**Needed**: Check if Docker services are healthy
**How**: Use ELB health checks or custom CloudWatch metrics

### 3. SSL/TLS Certificates
**Missing**: HTTPS configuration
**Needed**: 
- ACM certificates for ALB
- SSL for WebSocket connections
- TLS for COTURN

## üü¢ What's Working Now

### ‚úÖ 100% Automated Infrastructure
- Run `terraform apply` deploys everything
- 11 instances created automatically
- All networking configured
- Pilot light pattern working

### ‚úÖ Manual Failover Script
```bash
python3 failover-automation.py failover signaling  # Works!
python3 failover-automation.py failback signaling  # Works!
```

### ‚úÖ Cost Optimization
- NAT instances instead of NAT Gateway (saves $85/month)
- Pilot light backups (saves $75/month)
- Total: ~$150/month

## üìã Quick Fix Priority List

### Week 1: Fix Failover
1. Fix Lambda function to parse CloudWatch alarms
2. Add target group registration/deregistration
3. Test automatic failover end-to-end

### Week 2: Complete Load Balancers
1. Add all ALB listener rules
2. Configure NLB for TCP services
3. Set up proper health checks

### Week 3: Add DNS
1. Create Route53 hosted zone
2. Add health checks
3. Configure failover routing

### Week 4: Migrate to ASG
1. Deploy `asg-solution.tf`
2. Migrate services one by one
3. Delete old primary/backup instances

## üõ†Ô∏è Files to Focus On

1. **`simple-deploy.tf`** - Main working infrastructure (don't break this!)
2. **`failover-automation.py`** - Manual failover (working, could be improved)
3. **`fix-failover.tf`** - Attempted fixes (needs completion)
4. **`asg-solution.tf`** - Future solution (ready to deploy)

## üìù Testing Checklist

Before considering complete:
- [ ] Automatic failover triggers on instance failure
- [ ] Load balancer routes traffic to backup
- [ ] DNS updates to point to new instance
- [ ] Services remain accessible during failover
- [ ] Failback works without data loss

## üéØ Definition of "Done"

The infrastructure will be complete when:
1. `terraform apply` deploys everything
2. Instance failure triggers automatic failover
3. No manual intervention required
4. Services stay online during failures
5. Cost remains under $200/month

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Don't fight AWS patterns** - Use ASG, not custom failover
2. **Start with manual, automate later** - Manual script works fine
3. **Test failover during build** - Not after deployment
4. **Document everything** - Future you will thank you

## üöÄ Next Session Starting Point

1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/jupytertemi/jupiter-infrastructure-final.git`
2. Deploy infrastructure: `terraform apply`
3. Fix Lambda function in `failover-fixed.py`
4. Test automatic failover
5. If that fails, migrate to ASG solution
